Techniques to train your mind - passed on through ancient traditions and a modern
day [research proven](https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness/meditation) way to improve
life. There must be something to it, I concluded for myself. Here is what I
learned so far.

Mindfulness ([›wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness)) is a very broad
topic. Specifically, there are several techniques to obtain it and many positive outcomes
ascribed to it. In this post I refer to practices divorced from religious contexts that
gained popularity with John Kabat-Zinn's work
([›MBSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction)) from the 1970s
onward. At its core, it is about *observing* without willing to *change* things.
Mindfulness is claimed to improve mood, stress, intelligence, and quality of life in
general.

The not willing to change things part is described by many teachers as the paradox of
Mindfulness. Why would practicing not to want to change anything change anything about my
life? I believe that most people draw a parallel to common psychology wisdom, "Accept
things the way they are before you attempt to change them". From what I understand,
accepting things is a prerequisite to being mindful while the goal is rather inner peace
in the moment than an ability to change things in the future.

How do we become more mindful? There are different practices to *train* our mind. There is
*formal* practice, where you set aside time solely for the practice and meditate. And
there is informal practice. While doing any and all activities, pay attention, be present.
There are no truly great experiences if one is distracted.

So how is it we can train our minds to improve our lives? What is it that makes us
un-mindful? Here is what I think. All things we can be aware of appear in a "plane of
consciousness". This metaphor is often presented by Sam Harris in daily meditations on the
[Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/) app. This includes all we see, hear, or feel, all
thoughts we become aware of, and our sense of self.

In the meditations on Waking Up, you are often suggested to notice the character of your
consciousness with things appearing and disappearing and to "simply rest as that". You
train to recognize thoughts and to let them go. Chasing after thoughts to elicit further
similar thoughts is like poking back at your subconscious and a way to become distracted.
It is very natural to intelligent species to experiment, to act on the world and observing
its reaction, and it is the basis of all our knowledge. We act, observe, react, observe,
and so on. It seems to be possible though, that on this small scale we can develop an
unhelpful tendency to react as though on autopilot. These reactions need not necessarily
be physical actions, they might be us "poking back" at our subconscious for continuations
of thoughts irrelevant in the moment or for more of a particular feeling we became aware
of. In particular, I have discovered for myself, that constantly asking "And how does that
make me feel?" in response to thoughts and emotions makes me feel worse. Asking
repeatedly how something makes me feel does not let me find out more about the topic, it
strengthens the first emotional reaction no matter the importance of the topic.

Intertwined with the way we react to appearances in consciousness is *identification* and
the *self*. The psychology of what we identify with and the feeling of self seem to be
very complex and mystical. Mindfulness scholars recommend to recognize that the self is a
*construction of the mind* (Kabat-Zinn) or similar an *illusion* (Harris). They say that a
habit of continually forming a sense of "I" leads to less happiness. Furthermore, this
forming of the "I" seems to uncontrolledly comprise experiences and thoughts. Kabat-Zinn
talks about relating everything that happens to oneself in the unhealthy process of
"selfing", Harris recommends "breaking the identification with thought". Knowing that I
need not necessarily identify with every experience or thought feels liberating to me.
Paying close attention is the best way to do so.

Despite the fact that the aim of Mindfulness is not too difficult to express, there are
many facets to it and I feel that I have not discovered most of them. The time I
invested in formal meditation practice was worth it for me. I don't see it as drastically
"life changing" at this point and I might never become *enlightened* in the sense of its
origin traditions but I cannot deny having discovered something about my own mind and
it improved my mood and relations.
